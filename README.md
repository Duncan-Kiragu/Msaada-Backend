# MSAADA Backend

## Description:
The MSAADA backend repository contains the server-side code for the MSAADA platform, which aims to revolutionize disaster response in Kenya and beyond. This repository hosts the backend APIs responsible for user authentication, real-time communication, resource tracking, and volunteer coordination. Developed using Go, the backend ensures robust and scalable operations to support the platform's functionality.

## Tools:
- **Go (Golang):** A statically typed, compiled programming language designed for building reliable and efficient software.
- **Gin:** A web framework for Go that provides a lightweight and flexible HTTP router.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** A standard for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.
- **PostgreSQL:** An open-source relational database management system used for storing user data, resource information, and volunteer details.
- **Docker:** A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers to ensure consistency across different environments.
- **Swagger:** A tool for designing, building, documenting, and consuming RESTful APIs.

## To-Do List:
- [ ] Implement user authentication endpoints.
- [ ] Set up database integration with PostgreSQL.
- [ ] Define API endpoints for real-time communication, resource tracking, and volunteer coordination.
- [ ] Develop the logic for handling requests, processing data, and interacting with the database.
- [ ] Write unit tests to ensure the reliability and functionality of the APIs.
- [ ] Document API endpoints using Swagger for easy reference and consumption.
- [ ] Dockerize the application for easy deployment and scalability.
- [ ] Deploy the application 

## Features to be Added (TBD):
- Real-time alerts and notifications for users.
